= More Comprehensive async Integration Example

This example aims to show the best practice for a more complete integration.

It is based on a *cover*, emulating battery operated roller blinds.

The example includes extensive comments (that should be removed if making a true integration), to guide you through what each field and property is for. It includes 2 sensors tied to the primary cover device.

It's all implemented using a *push* model in *async*.

This example does not cover off on translations.
